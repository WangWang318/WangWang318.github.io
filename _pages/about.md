<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>
I'm currently a Ph.D student in [Gaoling School of Artificial Intelligence(GSAI)](http://ai.ruc.edu.cn/) in Renmin University of China(RUC) supervised by [Qi Qi](https://gsai.ruc.edu.cn/qiqi) and [Hao Sun](https://gsai.ruc.edu.cn/haosun). Prior to this, I received bachelor degree from the Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications (BUPT) and Queen Mary University of London (QMUL) Joint Programme majoring in Internet of Things(IoT) with First Class Honor.


<!-- My primary research interests lie at the intersection of AI and Game Theory, 
with particular emphasis on their applications in online advertising ecosystems, mechanism design, 
and the evolutionary dynamics of complex systems. Also, I am deeply engaged in developing and analyzing multi-agent decision-making systems. -->
My research interests are as follows:

- The intersection of Artificial Intelligence and Game Theory, with a particular focus on mechanism design and reinforcement learning within online e-commerce platforms.
- Multi-agent systems, specifically exploring multi-agent reinforcement learning and investigating the dynamics inherent in such systems.

<!-- # üôã‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Academic Involvement
- **Teaching Assistant** - Python Programming Language \
*Gaoling School of Artificial Intelligence (GSAI), Renmin University of China(RUC)*\
*Sep. 2024 - Present*\
Assisted in the instruction of Python programming, providing support during lectures and guiding students through hands-on coding exercises. Responsible for grading assignments, answering student queries, and offering one-on-one help during office hours to enhance students' understanding of fundamental programming concepts and practices. Contributed to course material development and provided feedback to improve course delivery. 

- **Guest Lecturer** - Principles of Communications \
*Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications(BUPT)*\
*Nov.  2022*\
 I delivered a specialized short lecture on the Principles of Communications to all students in my major. The lecture primarily focused on Fourier Transform, emphasizing its critical role in analyzing communication signals. I also covered key concepts related to the modulation and demodulation of analog and digital signals, providing insights into how these techniques are applied in real-world communication systems. Additionally, I discussed the design of transmission systems, exploring the fundamental principles that guide the efficient transmission of signals over various types of channels. This lecture provided a detailed understanding of these core concepts, offering my peers a strong foundation for advanced studies in communications. -->

# üòÄ Social Activities
- *2021-2022, 2022-2023* Member of BUPT Math club academic department.
- I really enjoy sports, especially basketball and fitness. Feel free to contact me if you are a big fan of the NBA (National Basketball Association) and would like to discuss it with me. 
<!-- In basketball, my favorite stars are James Harden, Jalen Brunson, and Manu Gin√≥bili. All of them have great basketball IQ. Most importantly, they started their careers coming off the bench and eventually became stars. I like to watch NBA game recordings and analyze the tactics. As for fitness, I not only like to improve my strength levels but also focus on functional training, which is training to enhance athletic performance. My dream is to one day use my knowledge to become an NBA trainer or assistant coach. -->
