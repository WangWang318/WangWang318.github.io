<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

I'm now an undergraduate student majored in Internet of Things(IoT) from Beijing University of Posts and Communications(BUPT) and Queen Mary University of London(QMUL) Joint Programme. In Sep.2024, I will pursue my Ph.D. degree in [Gaoling School of Artificial Intelligence(GSAI)](http://ai.ruc.edu.cn/) in Renmin University of China(RUC). My Ph.D. supervisors are [Hao SUN(孙浩)](https://gsai.ruc.edu.cn/haosun) and [Qi QI(祁琦)](https://gsai.ruc.edu.cn/qiqi).

My research interests include AI for Physics and AI for Economics. (Multi-agent) reinforcement learning is an excellent tool to help me explore these two fields. In my upcoming Ph.D. studies, I will focus on dynamics/equation discovery in complex networks. Such as exploring dynamics equations in bird flocking.
